						<ul class="sub-collection-list">
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">Responsibilities Overview</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">I work with a talented and hard-working group of eight Software Engineers and one Software Tester as the Development Team Lead / Manager for VersionOne's Platform and Integrations Team. Known internally as "openAgile", our team is a full-lifecycle team. We're responsible for the analysis, design, development, documentation, deployment, monitoring, support, and maintenance of full-stack applications, APIs, acceptance test automation, integrations, and cloud-based microservices.</span>
							</li>
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">Primary Technologies</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">Collaborating with other Atlanta teams and several remote teams in Chennai, India we work with a wide variety of languages and stacks, including C#, SQL Server, MongoDB, JavaScript / ECMAScript / TypeScript / Babel, AngularJS, React and Redux, Azure, EventStore, CSS/LESS, F#, Java, and Python. We also work with external devs contributing to our open source repos via GitHub PRs.</span></li>
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">Managerial Responsibilities</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">I lead our Scrum process for iteration planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. I also pair-program with and coach/mentor my team members on tech skills to learn/improve for successful delivery of products and services. I regularly meet with each teammate to listen to issues, concerns, and ideas for improvement of our culture. I write annual reviews for them and also incorporate peer feedback and their own goals.</span></li>
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">Community Investment</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">As part of VersionOne's mission to improve software development and contribute to our local community, we started <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoPonceSprings" target="_blank">CoderDojo Ponce Springs</a> in 2013 -- a free and fun place for Atlanta's kids to learn how to code. I serve as the main organizer with a dedicated team of volunteer mentors who help students learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Java, Python, Kotlin, and more.</span></li>
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">Honors</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">I received a "V1nny" during the 2nd quarter of 2016, a trophy awarded to employees who demonstrate VersionOne core values and have received numerous commendations from peers throughout the quarter.</span></li>

						<div class="sub-collection-heading">Major Projects</div>
						<ul class="sub-collection-list">
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">CommitStream Azure-cloud-based Service</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">Led architecture and development of CommitStream, an Azure-hosted microservice built with Node.JS, Express, mocha, EventStore, AngularJS, JSON, JSON Schema, and Hypertext Application Language (HAL). System comprised of auto-scaling App Services and 3 database VMs running EventStore in Clustered mode within an Availability Set and a Load Balancer. We host the code in GitHub and utilize continuous deployment based on Azure/GitHub code push deployments. The services listens for version control system commit event messages delivered by WebHooks or HTTP clients from cloud-based or on-premise servers. It hosts plugins, developed in-house and by third-party company contributors, that translate native event payloads into a common format. These events get summarized, stored, aggregated by work item, team, and program. The summaries surface within item detail and TeamRoom panes inside VersionOne's flagship agile ALM product. This allows large enterprises with teams that work with heterogeneous VCS tools and repos to quickly link their code changes to IDs of planned work items. It facilitates better daily agile/Scrum standup conversations. Worked with a team of local developers in Atlanta/Alpharetta and two remote developers in Argentina over nine months to develop and deploy into production. Our team actively updates, monitors, and supports this system via Pingdom, Pendo usage analysis, ZenDesk ticketing, and with Azure logging tools.</span>
							</li>
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">Bulk Web API Implementation</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">Led development of new Bulk API endpoint for the VersionOne API using C# 6, F# 4.1, YAML &amp; JSON, JetBrains Rider IDE, Node.js and TypeScript with the Ava test runner for end-to-end acceptance test automation. VersionOne's legacy REST API only supports the creation, modification, or operation-invocation of a single system entity per HTTP request. The Bulk API allows creating multiple new entities in one request, modifying multiple entities, or invoking operations on multiple entities via SQL-like queries. A single HTTP command can combine create, update, and execute commands. Adoption of this feature has increased performance speeds dramatically. As one example, bulk deleting of 2,000 expired messages takes less than two minutes now compared to upwards of 20 minutes with the leagcy endpoint.</span>
							</li>
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">Slack Plugin</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">Led design of Slack plugin for VersionOne that responds to in-app domain events and formats them for delivery to Slack Incoming WebHook endpoints to notify members about relevant work item events happening inside VersionOne. Built with C# 6, Visual Studio 2015, NUnit, StructureMap, and Log4Net. Collaborated with remote team in Argentina who completed features for the plugin.
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">Feature Plugins Support</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">Led project to introduce modular/pluggable feature support into VersionOne's ALM product. Accomplished this by separating interface/contract definitions of highly stable abstractions from concrete implementations and identifying extension points within the system's API routing and UX rendering sub-components. Discrete features get versioned and packaged as single DLLs (with module-specific views, APIs, DTOs, etc) capable of run-time deployment &amp; hot-swapping. This led to ability of feature teams to independently develop and test their features without the common branch and merge issues plaguing many monolithic codebases. Test engineers also now create test suites against the API layer and module contracts without being tightly-coupled to all implementation details.</span>

I also designed the programming test and led the technical interviewing process for hiring two additional .NET developers. To foster smooth progress for the rewrite, I introduced the team to the basic Scrum process and created agile boards and lanes and facilitated sprint planning and retrospective meetings. Our team completely redeveloped the UI and backend code for the legacy system, transitioning it from classic ASP, VBScript, SQL 2008, and custom JavaScript  to modern ASP.NET MVC and Web API, C#, jQuery-based JavaScript, and C# based Windows services. During our iterations, we worked with the medical and editorial staff and the support team to prioritize the most-used components of the system first and executed a continuous delivery model, getting working software into their hands early and often to get valuable feedback to guide the development completion.</span></li>

							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">Agile Adoption</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">Starting from the bottom-up I introduced the Scrum project management framework to the team by implementing a task wall in my own office. This quickly spread to other departments who began using "big visible charts" to help their own teams collaborate and communicate. We began to adopt agile practices and principles like collaborative estimation with Planning Poker, backlog item prioritization, collaborative code-reviews and pair-programming, unit testing, automated UI regression testing, and continuous integration using CruiseControl.NET. Following these technical improvements, we then moved the Scrum wall into a shared conference room and implemented daily Scrum meetings with the participation of company executives and other business stakeholders to demonstrate our progress and seek critical feedback as soon as possible. Next we began to involve our remotely located QA testers on a daily basis, pushing builds to them every day and tracking our progress through BugTracker.NET. Our end-of-sprint retrospectives are providing crucial input for process improvement from all participants. Executives, business stakeholders, developers, testers, and alpha users all reported great benefits from the agile adoption during these retrospectives.</span></li>
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">Entity framework major architectural refactoring</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">When I joined the team I was assigned to implement the complex security model (described below) for a new web application with the requirement that the existing legacy database data could populate the security model. The home-grown code-generation / ORM tool the team used featured statically generated stored-procedures, but the complex security requirements required that statements be generated on-the-fly to take into account ambient properties of the current context. I refactored the ORM tool to use C# generics and virtual base class methods to allow custom hooks into life-cycle events like CanSave, PreSave, PostSave, and so forth for the other CRUD operations. This allowed us to remove more than 3,000 static stored procedures across the several hundred database entities.</span></li>
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">Security Model Architecture and Implementation</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">Architected and implemented complex security model to interface a new web application with the company's flagship enterprise payroll processing system. The model requires security at the levels of User, Role, Filter, Field, Field Conditional, and Navigation Path. I implemented this using Test-First development to build up a suite of more than 40 unit tests, which has enabled us to confidently refactor and retest the internals over a number of months as requirements from our business stakeholders have forced adaptation.</span></li>

								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">With the support and motivation of the rest of our technical team, I helped lead the company, from the bottom up, to adopt Scrum as a project management framework by performing research into methodologies for high-performance, high-quality teams. I
	conducted numerous lunch-n-learn sessions to show recorded presentations from agile, Scrum, and Lean to educate the team about Scrum and agile. Adopting Scrum greatly improved our team productivity, morale, and ability to prioritize amongst many competing projects. Scrum's practice of keeping work items physically visible, as opposed to hidden away in a spreadsheet or in MS Project, provided an excellent tactic for improving communication and creating team commitment. After taking formal Scrum training I convinced the company
	CEO to send the entire team to attend Scrum training with Scrum co-inventor Jeff Sutherland to enable the
	whole team to be on the same footing moving forward. The company continues to use Scrum very successfully.</span></li>
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">Agile Practices & Build Process Improvement Adoption</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">Lead the introduction of
	agile design and development practices into the organization by
	focusing on process improvement essentials like automating regression
	test suites for core functionality, increasing code-coverage
	reporting for user acceptance and unit testing using Selenium, NCover
	and NUnit. This decreased the number of defects in our system and
	increased the reliability and repeatability of our testing scenarios,
	enabling us to more rapidly refactor the code-base to improve application quality.</span></li>
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">RESTful Web Service API Architecture</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">Lead the architectural design of the company's new Web Service API strategy. Rather than utilize tightly-coupled, RPC-centric SOAP based web services, we
	followed Google, eBay, Amazon, and Yahoo!'s lead by creating a simple REST-based API for allowing external users to POST and GET data to and from our backend system. I developed the high-level architecture and another senior engineer implemented the completed solution. The solution is based on .NET 3.5, ASP.NET MVC 1.0, and MvcContrib's
	SimplyRestful library.</span></li>
							<li><span class="sub-collection-item-title">Auction System Deployment and Stabilization</span>
								<span class="sub-collection-item-detail">Lead application architect for overseeing the deployment and stabilization of the new version of the flagship auction system into production for extensive beta testing. This involved running the new system "side-by-side" with the existing version and on top of the same database. Because the schemas differ from one version to the next, we utilized synonyms and views to expose the new version's structures on top of the legacy database. This approach enabled us to minimize risk
	and maximize early ROI by allowing customers to use the system while providing crucial feedback for essential refactorings.</span>

					<div class="item-dates s1">December 1999 - August 2000</div>
					<div class="item-description">During college I volunteered with the Mozilla organization to help fix bugs and build nightlies. I contributed JS and XUL code to the ChatZilla IRC client Mozilla extension, contributed C++ code to integrate SWIG with JS, and contributed POSIX regular expression C code to the open source X-Chat IRC client. I also created the JS-GTK JavaScript binding for the GTK+ windowing toolkit. I used CVS, LXR, and BugZilla extensively during this time and learned about iterative and incremental development practices and continuous integration.
