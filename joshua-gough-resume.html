				I believe that intelligent teams working directly with their users and customers create the best products, services, APIs, ecosystems, and communities. As a principal software engineer and team lead, I love helping teams deliver their best while delighting users and stakeholders. I guide teams in designing, developing, and delivering modular platforms, architectures, and complete systems that are easy to understand, automate, deploy, maintain, and extend by in-house teams, third-party partners, and open source contributors.

			<div class="para">
				Since 2020, I’ve worked extensively with Kotlin/Java and Spring Boot on the JVM, deployed on AWS with Kubernetes (EKS). From 2002 to 2020, I specialized in C# and F# on .NET and Microsoft Azure. I’m always open to new languages and stacks and enjoy working with teams across diverse technologies. To keep my skills sharp, I regularly complete courses on Pluralsight.com, Coursera, and Udemy. I thrive on collaborating with motivated individuals who are committed to continuous learning, technical excellence, and community involvement.

				I’ve been active in several community initiatives in Atlanta. From 2013 to 2020, I founded and organized <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoPonceSprings" target="_blank">CoderDojo Ponce Springs</a>, a free space for Atlanta's kids to learn coding with support from parents and mentors. In 2008, I founded the Atlanta ALT.NET user group for .NET developers to share knowledge and connect. That same year, I co-founded <a href="http://www.meetup.com/AtlantaScienceTavern" target="_blank">The Atlanta Science Tavern</a>, a community bringing together science enthusiasts and professionals to share ideas.

								<ul>
									<li>Led a squad of four developers and a test engineer to design and implement the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) microservice, ensuring full compliance with PSD2 regulations for multi-factor authentication (MFA) in online payments.</li>
									<li>Built with Spring Boot and Spring HATEOAS, following RESTful architecture principles and utilizing hypermedia-driven state transitions (HAL) for resource representation.</li>
									<li>Our team used an Outside-in "walking skeleton" TDD approach. While SAP Concur was in vendor negotiations, the test engineer and I created an end-to-end scenario test with in-memory workflow representations, later fleshing out service internals while ensuring the tests remained successful.</li>
									<li>Supported 3D Secure 2.0, handling both frictionless and challenge flows, ensuring secure cardholder authentication directly with financial institutions during online transactions.</li>
									<li>Implemented auto-submitting forms in hidden and visible iframes, which load content directly from financial institutions, preventing sensitive data from passing through Concur's network or intermediaries.</li>
									<li>Rendered these iframes using React components, integrating seamlessly into both Concur's legacy UI and the new V4 interface.</li>
									<li>Secured communication with JWT for user authentication and mutual TLS (mTLS) for encrypted channels between Concur services and 3DS vendor Netcetera.</li>
									<li>Utilized an event-sourced architecture with AWS DynamoDB, storing transaction workflow steps as discrete events, enabling state hydration and enforcing workflow invariants.</li>

This allowed each customer team to extend the standard API response for their sub-domain-specific needs without altering the core contract or affecting other teams.</li>
									<li>Designed an API query parameter, <b>expansion</b>, to allow customer teams to request domain-specific payment configuration data from the monolithic database for short-term expediency while teams continue to take ownership of their own configuration data.</li>
									<li>We implemented an automated acceptance that runs on unstable pod deployments to both integration and production to ensure the air team's specific configuration remains stable as well corresponding tests to ensure no adverse impact to requests that do not contain the new parameter.</li>

									<li>Worked closely with other engineers to implement new features and fixes in our Java, Go, and Kotlin payments bounded context microservices.</li>
									<li>Configured an Envoy sidecar container of an upstream team's OTCrypto service for our payments microservice to avoid latency when decrypting stored credit card numbers from the legacy database.

									<li>During a Travel-organization wide performance readiness initiative, I worked closely with our Test Engineer running extensive JMeter tests. We identified a CPU-bound bottleneck caused by redundant calls to <b>SecretKeyFactory.generateSecret</b>, which was adding 140ms per request. Another engineer had earlier noticed this number when she ran her own NewRelic profiling analysis.</li>
									<li>Implemented a caching solution with ElastiCache, storing security tokens for 5 minutes, reducing unnecessary cryptographic operations and improving throughput to handle over 55,000 HTTP requests with minimal latency. This ensured that even when requests arrived to a different pod, the token was rapidly available via ElastiCache, obviating the need for the pod to run the encryption algorithm on its own.</li>
									<li>Optimized the system to scale from handling 2,107 to over 68,000 requests within the same test runtime, significantly improving system resilience and real-world performance under load and reducing the deployment's propensity to spin up new pods in vain attempts to handle the increase CPU-bound load.</li>

								<p>As the lead technical analyst, created a client deliverable consisting of a technical architecture assessment of the client's existing $150 million sales-generating sporting goods auction application. Analyzed C++, COM, ASP 3.0, and SQL Server 2000 components.</p>
								<p>Recommended a hybrid horizontal and vertical migration strategy to ASP.NET 2.0 and C#. The horizontal migration involved implementing a new front-end layer in ASP.NET while using RCW interop assemblies for short-term reusability and maximizing the existing investment. The vertical migration focused on new functionality modules, recommending they be written in pure C# without a COM middle layer.</p>

					<div class="item-description">During college I volunteered with the Mozilla organization to help fix bugs and build nightlies. I contributed JS and XUL code to the ChatZilla IRC client Mozilla extension, contributed C++ code to integrate SWIG with JS, and contributed POSIX regular expression C code to the open source X-Chat IRC client. I also created the JS-GTK JavaScript binding for the GTK+ windowing toolkit. I used CVS, LXR, and BugZilla extensively during this time and learned about iterative and incremental development practices and continuous integration.
